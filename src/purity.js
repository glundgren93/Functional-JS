/* Purity

 One way of reducing the complexity of softwares is reducing or
 eliminating state change in our programs.

 A pure function contains the following properties:
  - Its result is calculated only from the values of its arguments.
  - It cannot rely on data that changes external to is control.
  - It cannot change the state of something external to its body.

Given the same arguments, pure functions always return the same output.

Pure functions are important for:
 - Functional programming
 - Concurrency
 - Writing testable code
 - Having predictable code
